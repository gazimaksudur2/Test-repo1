I was born in a village that located in Tangail district.
It was 25th May, 2001. I was the second prestigious member of our family.
Then my life started with the combination of a big family.
I started growing with the nature.
Then my grandmother passed away when I was just 8 or 9.
I also miss my uncle who was murdered by the people and my beloved grandfather.
May allah also forgive them. These are edited from master branch.
